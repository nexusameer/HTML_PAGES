		<h1>17 Best Website Ideas For Beginners: Unique<br> Content and Topics Ideas</h1>
		<p>October 6, 2021 â€¢DJ Team</p>

		<p align="jump">
			Starting a new business can be challenging, but not for the reasons you think.<br>
A lot of business owners get overwhelmed by the idea of having to set up their site.Luckily, you don't need to learn how to code to get<br> your site going. But there are still a lot of steps and things to learn.<br>

In this article, we'll cover all the various types of websites you could build, site ideas to get your creative juices flowing, and <br>helpful tips on how to make this process a breeze.<br>

Let's dive in.
Most people believe that running the business, managing a team, and doing the financials is the hardest part. But for a lot of <br>entrepreneurs, the first hurdle is setting up the website.<br>
		</p>
		<h1>Website Ideas</h1>
		<p>
			First, let's talk about the type of website you need.<br>

There are several main types of websites that you could create. Each type is going to have  own design and structural requirements and <br>its own unique purpose. Here are the main ones.<br>
		</p>
		<h1>1. E-commerce Websites</h1>
		<p>
			Any website that sells goods online is an e-commerce site. It could be a stand-alone store or a store that's just a small part <br> of the business (like the Google store that sells T-shirts and cups with the Google logo). <br>

An e-commerce site usually consists of a homepage, category pages, products pages, and a checkout page. It also has various promotional <br>pages, a referral/loyalty program, and a customer service page where consumers go to get answers to their questions. <br>
		</p>
		<h1>2. Blogs</h1>
		<p>
			Blogs are one of the most popular types of websites on the internet. There are over 600 million blogs online today and <br>billions of blog posts. Blogs provide a very powerful mechanism for brands to increase brand awareness, tell their brand <br> story, attract readers through content marketing, and make money through affiliate marketing. The two most popular blogging<br>platforms are WordPress and Medium and many publications are built and run on them.
		</p>
		<h1>Website Ideas for Beginners</h1>
		<p>Here are a few website ideas to give you even more inspiration when building your own site. Take<br> what you find interesting and applicable and leave the rest.</p>
		<h1>1. Personal Blog</h1>
		<p>One of the best ways to build an engaged audience online is to start your own blog. Choose a topic <br> that you are passionate about and knowledgeable about. Pick a blog topic by looking at similar blogs <br> or conducting some keyword research.

		<h3>(DemandJump Idea Generator and Automated Pillar Page Strategy Tool)</h3>
		<p>You can use a tool like DemandJump to generate website content ideas for your next post and to <br> optimize your content for search engines.</p>
		<h1>2. Drop-Shipping Site</h1>
		<p>A really popular way to sell products online is through drop-shipping. This involves sourcing your <br>products on a site like Alibaba and then have the manufacturer ship the product directly to your <br> consumers.</p>
		<h1>3. Start an Online Course</h1>
		<p>Another great way to promote yourself is by developing an online course. Creating video content is <br>much more affordable today than even a few years ago.</p>
		<h1>4. Sell Handmade Items</h1>
		<p>This one will take a bit more time and isn't for the faint of heart. It's for creators of products that <br> would like to take their hobby to the next level. You can also sell other people's handmade products <br>and make a commission.</p>
		<h1>5. Local Events/Travel Destinations</h1>
		<p>If you enjoy meeting people and traveling, then this idea is for you. Create a site where you not only <br> offer advice on the best local travel spots and tourist destinations, but you can also organize meetups <br>	 and local tours.</p>
		<h1>Website Design Ideas</h1>
		<p>
			Creating a website can be quite challenging for beginners. Most people don't know where to start. They might want to start <br>with a simple website builder, but then realize that it doesn't have all the <br>features they need. A platform like WordPress or Magento can seem daunting to beginners. It's all<br> about figuring out what your needs are.
		</p>
		<p>Here are a few criteria to consider before picking your ideal website platform.<br>
		Price - What is your monthly budget? <br>
		Expertise - How savvy are you with web design or website building platforms?<br>
		Goals - What are your goals? Do you want to set up an online shop? A blog? A review site?<br>
		Integrations - Make sure the platform you're considering has all the integrations that you need. These could include integrations to <br>payment portals, email marketing tools, content syndication, or shopping carts.<br>
		SEO - Remember to check the technical setup of the site. Does your platform have all the technical aspects of SEO set up? Will search <br>engines recognize and be able to easily crawl your site and rank it on relevant search results?</p>
